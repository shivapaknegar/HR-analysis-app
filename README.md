# HR-analysis-app
How the Application Works
This application is designed to simplify and streamline HR data analysis. Here’s how it functions step-by-step:
1. Start:
The process begins when the user accesses the application to analyze their employee data. The user is prompted to upload an Excel file containing the required dataset.
2. Data Upload:
The user uploads the employee dataset through the upload box on the homepage.
The file is processed by the system to ensure it adheres to the specified format and contains all required columns.
3. Validate Data:
The system automatically validates the uploaded data to check for issues like missing values, incorrect formats, or incomplete fields.
If the data is invalid:
An error message is displayed, explaining the issue.
The user must fix the errors in the dataset and reupload the corrected file.
If the data is valid:
The dataset is successfully stored in the application’s database for further analysis.
4. Dashboard Access:
Once the data is validated and stored, the user is granted access to the dashboard.
On the dashboard, the user can:
Search for specific employees or filter data by attributes like department, role, or gender.
View a filtered results table displaying the requested data.
5. Generate Insights and Visualizations:
The application allows the user to:
Download filtered data for offline use.
Generate key insights and visualizations such as:
Attrition analysis to identify trends in employee turnover.
Workforce distribution visualizations to see how employees are spread across roles and departments.
Graphs and charts representing salary distribution, attrition rates, and other metrics.

6. Export Insights Report:
Users can export a detailed report summarizing the key metrics and insights generated by the application. This report includes visualizations and data-driven insights for HR decision-making.
7. API Integration Testing:
The application ensures all API endpoints (e.g., for filtering data, generating insights) are functional and reliable. This step ensures the system is robust and ready for real-world use.

8. End:
The workflow concludes once the user has analyzed their data and exported the necessary reports. The application remains ready for future use, allowing the user to upload new datasets and repeat the process as needed.
